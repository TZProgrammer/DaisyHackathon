       "  'I wanted to try out this product for the \"skin/hair care\" side of it though this product is \"pure\" enough that a little in my soup or skillet creates a nice  nutty aroma and mild taste - really good in this coconut curry soup I eat.That said I brought the jar into my bathroom to keep it there instead of for cooking (I\\'ll purchase another one for the kitchen). The one negative I have with this product for skin is that it\\'s so thick and hard I really have to dig in there to get a bit; however once it\\'s in the palm of my hand the warmth of my skin melts it quite quickly. It can feel a little heavy and greasy at first and the scent of coconut makes me think of cooking and not \"beauty product;\" but I mixed it with a little of my regular hand/body lotion and that was the ticket - it smoothed on my skin quite nicely and created a kind of \"sheen\" like those starlets have on their skin as they walk the red carpet with an insipid grin. Mixing it toned down the coconut scent too.I did smooth it on my face straight and it did absorb quickly and the scent of coconuts wasn\\'t so strong after a few minutes. I have slightly sensitive skin with a little rosacea and the product didn\\'t break me out or irritate my skin.But! The best \"beauty\" use I had from this product that SOLD me is what it did to my hair! One morning I smoothed the coconut oil on my hair paying particular attention to the ends. I threw my hair up in a ponytail and left the coconut oil in for at least an hour and a half. I rinsed it out with very warm water and then I shampooed twice. When I stepped out of the shower I realized I was going to be late for an appointment. I quickly combed my hair dressed jumped into my car and let the opened windows dry my hair every so often shaking it out and combing through with my fingers -- I couldn\\'t believe it! by time I reached my appt 35 minutes away my hair was soft and smooth -  even with the wind hitting it - no blow-dryer - no brushing it out - when I returned from the appt - again the windows open blowing my hair all over creation I brushed my hair and it was so soft and shiny and smooth. That sold me -- if I don\\'t use this product for anything else it\\'s worth it for how it made my hair look and feel!UPDATE! - I bought another container of this to use in the kitchen - omg! If you saute shrimp in it you not only have the aroma of coconut but the shrimp taste incredible! I also fry or scramble eggs with it - mmmmmm - this stuff is amazing.'],\n",

       "  \"I ordered this to use as a moisturizer on my face as my skin is very sensitive. I was looking for a natural and inexpensive product and this sounded like a good thing to try. I have been very happy with it. I mix a small bit with some 100% Pure Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz and put it on my face after showering.It feels wonderful and leaves my skin feeling smooth all day. I use to have very dry skin and would break out with the worst case of acne almost on a weekly occurrence. The almond and coconut oil have been amazing. There are ton of other uses for them as well.I use the coconut oil in the shower sometimes too. It has a wonderfully light coconut smell and leaves my hair conditioned and moisturized without any buildup. It rinses very easily and gives my hair that extra bounce. I will keep looking for more uses for these oils I could go on forever how great they are but I won't! Instead I'll just say for what I've used them for so far they've been just great!\"],\n",

       "  \"I use a lot of extra virgin coconut oil so much that I usually buy the Nutiva 2-pack of 54-ounce jars. I tried Vitacost's and didn't like it as much as Nutiva so I've stuck with the Nutiva and really had not planned to switch brands. When I was offered the opportunity to review the Viva Labs product I agreed but was doubtful I was going to be swayed.Well let me tell you when I opened up this coconut oil I was amazed at the difference. This is an extra virgin coconut oil I could actually imagine myself taking by the tablespoonful as was recommended by several health books my sister shared with me for people suffering from candida albicans infections. I've used my Nutiva for popping popcorn cooking and for skin care but now I'm thinking I'll just use up the Nutiva for frying and go straight for the Viva Labs version for everything else. There's just no contest.A great use for this coconut oil is as a butter replacement on toast. My Nutiva spreads and melts like one of those margarines that take a long time to melt; the Viva Labs spreads like softened butter and melts like a dream.Price-wise I've been spending about 47 cents an ounce for the Nutiva when I buy it in the big bulk pack. I was thinking that at almost 62 cents an ounce for the 15-ounce container the Viva Labs was more expensivealthough I'd have to say it's worth it. But when I went to cost out some of the other Nutiva products they ran as much per ounce if not more than the Viva Labs product.I'm impressed enough that I'll be switching.\"],\n",

       "  'Viva Labs\\' Coconut Oil was offered to me free for review and I loved it!  It comes in a plastic jar and can be a liquid or a solid depending on the temperature of your home.  When I received it it was a liquid so I put a little in a squirt bottle (for the shower - see below) but the next day it was a solid because of the temperature inside my home - I just ran the bottle under some warm water and it quickly liquefied so I could squeeze it out.After receiving my Viva Labs\\' Coconut Oil I ventured out onto the web to see what I could use it for and wow!  There are loads of different ways to use coconut oil:* Cooking* Baking* Skin Care* Hair Care* Aromatherapy* Kitty Cats (put it on their paws to reduce hairballs and promote a shiny coat)* Google it and I am certain you will find a million ways to use it!So how did I use it?In the kitchen:  I was thinking that it would only be good in dishes that were sweet but it doesn\\'t have a sweet taste at all.  I actually fried an egg with it and I couldn\\'t tell that I didn\\'t use regular oil.  Coconut oil has a high smoke point so frying an egg was totally fool-proof and I did notice that it didn\\'t spatter all over the stove like vegetable oil does and my favorite thing about it was that my kitchen didn\\'t smell like fried food for days - which is one of the main reasons I never fry anything!Shower: I always use baby oil (while my skin is wet) as a moisturizer so instead of my baby oil I switched it up and started using the coconut oil.  A little bit goes a long way but it soaks into the skin quite nicely and left me feeling silky smooth with no greasy feeling and it smells delicious!Makeup Remover:  I also use baby oil to remove my waterproof mascara so I used the coconut oil and it worked like a charm!Exfoliator:  I also used it as an exfoliator on my hands feet and body - mix it with a little sugar while you are in the shower.  It is an inexpensive way to get rid of that dry and flaky skin and again...  leaves you with silky smooth skin.I saw that you could use it as a deep conditioning treatment on your hair - it works there too - I smoothed A LITTLE on my hair and left it overnight and then washed it out in the morning.  My hair was nice and shiny and didn\\'t look greasy at all.  My hair is super short but I could imagine that a person who might really notice a difference would be someone with long hair who battles with their hair being dry and or frizzy would really notice a difference.Finally you can use it as a sexual lubricant - yes well you know!  It wouldn\\'t be a \"Bookie Nookie\" review if I didn\\'t bring something naughty into it!  There is ZERO sugar in coconut oil - which is a common concern when using \"food\" products that are sweet in or around those girly parts (sugar in THAT area can cause a yeast infection o_O).  There were no issues with that and definitely reduced the friction and helped things glide quite nicely :-DViva Labs\\' Coconut Oil is definitely a product I would use again and I would and have recommended it to my friends.  At around 11 bucks for a 16-ounce jar it\\'s affordable and has a million uses - you have nothing to lose by checking it out. Product provided by Viva Labs for an honest review.'],\n",

       "  'In the last few months I\\'ve reviewed two books that touted the value of coconut oil and its many uses. When I searched for \"coconut oil\" in Amazon books I got several thousand hits. It\\'s definitely a hot topic these days yet I can remember when the consumption of coconut oil was widely disparaged because of its saturated fat. Fast forward a few decades and although some health authorities still don\\'t like coconut oil the tide has turned and the oil is being praised for its many benefits both internal and external.The Viva Labs product is \"extra virgin.\" Since it hasn\\'t been refined or heavily processed it has a very mild coconut taste and aroma both of which were very pleasant to my palate and nose. The melting temperature is about 76 F so at most room temperatures the oil has a soft creamy texture. I tried a spoonful and it\\'s quite tasty. I then fried some breaded shrimp in the oil and it was delicious. I\\'m looking forward to substituting coconut oil for olive or canola oil in some of the recipes my wife and I use.Healthwise because much of the saturated fat of extra virgin coconut oil is in the form of lauric acid coconut oil is considered to be a better alternative to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils when solid fats are required. In addition virgin coconut oil is composed mainly of medium-chain triglycerides (aka \"healthy fats\") which may not carry the same risks as other saturated fats. Recent findings indicate that daily consumption of coconut oil may boost brain performance and could even help to prevent Alzheimer\\'s.The two books on coconut oil that I reviewed also mentioned the external uses of the product for improving skin moisture and appearance and for aromatherapy and massage therapy. It can even be used as a restorative treatment on hair.Coconut oil is definitely a hot product today and my experience with the Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil has been very positive.'],\n",

In comparison to the brand of coconut oil I typically buy the Viva Labs brand has a faint but noticeable aroma of coconut.The consistency is creamy and when rubbed onto the skin it dissolves instantly and absorbs without leaving a greasy residue. I rubbed some on a laceration on my leg and the coconut oil relieved the itching and left the skin noticeable softer and smoother.I used it in baking and frying with excellent results. My family gobbled up the biscuits and fried potatoes and the only comment they made was that the fried potatoes had just a hint of coconut flavor. However everyone agreed it was an intriguing flavor twist.Our favorite experiment with using the oil was to pop some organic popcorn. We all agreed the coconut oil added a little extra flavor to the corn and I ended up popping two batches because everyone wanted more.I am not going to discuss price point comparisons because to me other considerations are more important than price. For my family I\\'m willing to pay a few cents more to get an organic product that is packaged in a BPA free container and certified by the NON GMO Project as a pure food. It\\'s also important to me for the oils I use to be extra-virgin cold pressed and unrefined so Viva Labs Coconut Oil is the perfect match for my household needs.I\\'d recommend this product to anyone who is concerned about the increasing proliferation of genetically modified organisms being introduced into our food supply and looking for a healthier option.Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut OilDisclosure of Material Connection: I received this Coconut Oil free  book free from Viva Labs in exchange for a product review.

And it could just be me but coconut oil also seems to make my usually fragile strands more elastic and thus less prone to breakage (if that makes any sense).For me coconut oil works best when worked into natural hair that has been slightly \"dampened\" with water or a water-based product (like conditioner) and then bunned or banded for several hours (like overnight). When I let my hair down it\\'s as soft as a baby\\'s...skin. I apply the product either as a solid (body heat melts it) or as a liquid (melted in the microwave). btw I also use the coconut oil for pre-poos hot oil treatments scalp massages or simply sealing moisture in my hair.Needless to say I really like the product. It\\'s versatility and the effectiveness that it seems to have on my natural was enough to make me want to buy it again. Just to give an estimate a 16 oz container lasts me about a 1 1/2 months when I use a LOT (I have short-medium hair).The only con if it is a con is that this product will stiffen and return to its solid form when exposed to the cold (I don\\'t know the exact temperature).

Fragrance wise it shouldn't be confused with fresh juicy coconut as this is slightly smoky  the oil has a delicate toffee like caramel coco tone that only lingers for a bit and doesn't clash with perfume if anything those lipids will give it extra staying power. When the weather cools this solidifies but I just scoop it out and honestly this rarely leaves my bathroom. My favorite way of using it is after a shower or a bath a nice thin layer of this oil scooped out and smoothed between the hands all over it makes for the most luxurious skin treatment that leaves me feeling very relaxed it's great in the morning if I'm not in a rush it might take few minutes to skin in but it's especially wonderful at night. After using it I ooze into my bed and sleep deliciously it's very soothing and spa like my muscles always feel warm and pampered and it makes for the softest skin even pricier creams don't work this well I guess it's the nature and not chemical processes doing all the hard work.This is definitely edible I know that I tend to use it more as a beauty treatment but many people take coconut oil as a supplement as well  I have cooked curries with it; Thai and Indian types very tasty but not to be over heated as it can separate. For some reason the Viva labs brand feels better on my skin and hair I have used the Nature's Way brand and it was good but this feel superior when used on the skin something about it if beyond soothing and leaves the skin extra smooth I'm going through a very hard cold winter in NY now and I use this oil in the am and pm after showering my skin feels beyond soft a real saver in bad weather when lotions aren't enough. This oil also makes for the best hair treatment rub some in for a few hours and then shampoo out for the glossiest locks.- Kasia S.\"],\n",

I didn't cook with it.That said I used it every day on my face for a month.  I was pleasantly surprised by its ability to be quickly absorbed.  It feels oily when it's applied but not after about 15 minutes.  It doesn't alter the skin long term like a peel or a serum might but in terms of hydration I found it to be very effective.  I have very dry skin especially in cold weather so applying the product to my cheeks daily protected my face from the cold and made it appear more hydrated.  I'm 44 and am just starting to get lines around my eyes and mouth - they were considerably less visible each time I used the product on my face.  This trial certainly proved that hydrated skin looks better!  I am not super fond of the smell but it dissipates very quickly.  I also wear a physical sunblock daily along with a bit of foundation - the coconut oil didn't have a negative effect on those companion products.  I used my daily serum then the coconut oil then my sunblock/foundation combo.I recommend this for anyone struggling with keeping your skin hydrated especially in the cold.Thanks for the sample Viva - nice product.\"],\n",

It was inconvenient because there\\'s a nice white space on the opposite side of the jar that would have been perfect for the sticker so as not to block the \"instructions.\"  I had to scrape and peel off the label so that I could see the suggested uses.

(Read my fourth paragraph.)I enjoy using coconut oil in my cooking and I\\'ll even work a tablespoon into my hair every once in a while--especially in cold dry weather.I have been using Jarrow\\'s Extra Virgin Expeller Pressed Coconut Oil prior to trying this one from Viva.  They are very close in taste:  Both are organic with wonderful flavor and coconut smell.  I think maybe Viva\\'s is a little fuller and stronger in flavor.  There is a big difference in price (comparing 15 and 16 ounce jars not larger 2 pound jars) at this point in time with Viva being much more economical.  I recommend giving it a try.I was curious between the difference in how the coconut oil is extracted:  Viva\\'s oil is a \"cold pressed\" extraction process while Jarrow\\'s is \"expeller pressed\".  This is what I found out while researching:  \"Expeller pressed\" involves squeezing the oil out by way of a screw-type process.  Temperatures can reach up as high as 99 degrees Celsius.  \"Cold pressed\" actually presses the oil out and the process takes place at low temperatures usually below 60 degrees Celsius.  Bottom line?  The cold pressed method will preserve a bit more of the nutrients because of the lower temperature.  So again Viva comes out the winner.I received a sample of this oil from Viva Labs and I will be buying a jar from them when this runs out because I do like it very much.

Times are changing and now it's being recognized for the many benefits it offers both in the heart-healthy diet and also as an external beauty aid.  Lauric acid which is a saturated fat in coconut oil has been shown to increase the good HDL cholesterol in the blood to help improve cholesterol ratio levels.  Studies also show that consuming coconut oil can help us with resistance to both viruses and bacteria as well as fighting off yeast fungus and candida.In the kitchen I love coconut oil for stir-frying vegetables and also as a base for salad dressings.  I've tried to increase the amount of fresh kale that our family eats and I find that the coconut oil adds a sweetness to the sometimes-bitter kale that other oils can't provide.  For supplements that are supposed to be taken with fat I find it simple and tasty to just take them with a small teaspoon of the coconut oil straight from the jar.Viva Labs' extra virgin coconut oil has a very mild coconut taste and aroma.  It hasn't been refined or heavily processed and it has a creamy texture that sets up quite solid at cool temperatures and transforms to a much softer or near liquid form at very warm room temperatures.  I especially like the fact that it's certified organic and non-GMO (not genetically modified).I love using coconut oil outside of the kitchen also.  It's a wonderful hair conditioner and body moisturizer with its abundance of protective vitamin E.  Just scoop a small amount out of the jar and allow it to warm and soften/liquefy in the palm of your hand.  For my hair I'll then rub my hands together and massage the oil through my hair and scalp.  I try to leave it on for at least an hour before showering and shampooing my hair.  As a moisturizer it smooths into your skin with a bit of a sheen but leaves behind a nice fresh scent.Coconut oil is also great for pets.  I give both of my dogs coconut oil every day...about a teaspoon for the little one and nearly a tablespoon for our large German Shepherd (gradually increase to that amount).  I've also used it on dry cracked paw pads.  It softens and soothes them and unlike other moisturizers it isn't harmful if licked off by your pet.  In fact it's healthy for them if they do.Much of what I've read on coconut oil suggests a daily adult intake to be around two tablespoons per day for maximum benefit.A product sample was provided for reviewing purposes.\"],\n",

I bought some from a local producer here in Ohio from a farmer\\'s market (and have lost the name of the company and won\\'t bother to get it again).  I have also used Sonoma Harvest from California.  In fact I still have some of the Sonoma Harvest left in my kitchen so I did a side-by-side taste test.  The Viva brand is a much purer white color and tastes more truly of fresh coconut. I don\\'t know if that matters to you but it does to me.  I am using it in my cupcake baking right now.  It cooks up lovely.  Its not an overwhelming taste but you can see the etiology of the oil from the origin.  The fact that its 100% Certified Organic is nice and extra virgin too.  I often use this coconut oil when I make oatmeal: about a tablespoon mixed in after cooking to have a pleasant way to eat it for the prevention of Alzheimer\\'s onset.  As far as a skin lubricant I am testing these side by side as well. The Sonoma Harvest is \\'greasier\\' feeling anddoesn\\'t absorb as nicely.  The other brand has a slightly rancid odor as well.  All in all I find Viva brand to be superior in every way that counts.  One other comment.  For those who really are concerned about Alzheimer\\'s I found a recent tip from the Edgar Cayce readings....published in Venture Inward magazine awhile back.  I will quote it in its entirety:  Its from Kevin Todeschi\\'s column A.R.E. Today (www.edgarcayce.org for more details).\"Physically:  \"In the 30+ years I have been involved in the study and application of the Edgar Cayce material I have been helped in countless ways.  At the present it appears that the Cayce health readings are literally saving me from the fate of both my parents and six older siblings all of whom now suffer from or have died with Alzheimer\\'s. I started using the Radiac seven years ago about the age the earliest signs of Alzheimer\\'s showed up in most of my family.  (Two had acute Alzheimer\\'s and died in their 50\\'s and 60\\'s).  At the present time I have none of their symptoms.  I shared the Radiac information with my one younger sibling who is following my lead and using the Radiac.

I literally can not but any type of moisturizer on my skin or anything with any kind of spf without my face breaking out horribly.

I will continue to use this product as long as it continues to make my face feel and look this great.I also tried using it in my hair which was another use I read about online.

I woke up early and put some of the coconut oil in my hair and let it soak in for about 30 minutes and then washed it out which took about two washes to get it all out. I know a lot of articles suggested leaving it in for a few hours but since my hair is light and thin I didn't want it to be too oily. The 30 minutes seemed to be the perfect amount of time.

I'm an avid coconut oil coconut water coconut sugar and coconut milk user.The first thing I noticed about this product was the USDA ORGANIC label. Many other labels don't have that same recognition. The second thing I noticed when I opened my container was I could smell fresh coconuts. For me I love the smell and it made me feel like this product was more fresh. I have never tried any other brands that have that smell when you open it up.Now for the unfortunate part of my coconut oil smelling like coconuts. When I'm trying to cook with it and or use it on my popcorn with my special seasonings it leaves that coconut/sun tan lotion smell on my food. It tasted GREAT! I mean it was much lighter and cleaner tasting then most but sometimes I try to hide the fact that I use that oil on my food for others sake. My neighbor and friends HATE coconut and when I tried serving it to my neighbor and friends they wouldn't even try it because they could smell the coconut.SO if you don't mind the coconut smell then I would say this is a great choice because it does taste better.\"],\n",

I whipped up a small batch of oil with some essential oils to slather on after my shower and this oil was the best! It absorbed into my damp skin beautifully and left me feeling velvety soft until my next shower. The texture is wonderful and the taste is very pleasant especially for oil pulling and toothpaste. I have also been using this jar as a carrier for my essential oils and the very subtle scent of coconut is refreshing and does not take away from the scent of the oils.

I'd been using other products found at my local organic grocer but never gave much thought to the consistency or oil textures.  Viva's is amazing!  It melts uniformly and solidifies uniformly.I decided to give the product a thorough test drive so I used it as prescribed on the label.  For hair and scalp care it has done wonders clearing up my dry scalp and I no longer need to use conditioner.  In fact I was pretty thrilled to know that I wasn't putting any unnatural chemicals on my body.  I had a blister that healed quickly by rubbing some of it on which took away the pain also.Since receiving the sample of Viva Coconut Oil two weeks ago I started adding a teaspoon to my tea in the morning.  What I noticed after about a week is that my appetite for unhealthy foods has been curbed significantly and I attribute this to the magic of coconut oil as a dietary supplement.  I decided to take a break from olive oil and use only the Viva Labs coconut oil for cooking.  I like the way the oil flavored a couple of ahi tuna stakes when I grilled them.  I even made a coconut cream cake (dairy free) using this oil.  The cake's consistency was nothing short of high end which I attribute to the quality of the main ingredient coconut oil.For the discriminating health conscious consumer I highly recommend this product and will seek it out next time I'm shopping for coconut oil.

So I took  a spoon ( that my husband says his and only his ... so don't tell him) and let them lick a little oil thinking they would taste it and leave after them the firkin cats had to get in on the action and the next thing I know I had to lock everyone out of the Kitchen.

It has a smoother texture and a delightful coconut flavor.  I love it for cooking.  It can be used as a spread instead of butter and my husband likes it on his oatmeal.  I also make an uncooked sugar free chocolate candy with it.  When refrigerated it is as firm as any chocolate candy bought in the store with a texture similar to chocolate truffles.  I also love what coconut oil does for my skin.  Since I have begun using coconut oil as a moisturizer I can see a difference in the texture of my skin.  I transfer some into a small sterile jar and keep it with my toiletries.  Why use expensive creams when I can use something natural that gives my skin a more youthful appearance and a glow?  Really--I'm not kidding.So I am back to including coconut oil in more of my meals.  Last summer I lost 8 pounds by substituting coconut oil for some of my butter and by cutting back to almost no sugar.  I think I am ready to do that again since recently I have been a little lax in watching what I eat.  Using coconut oil is a healthy alternative to other types of fats and it actually helps improve the body from the inside out.  I put it in pancakes muffins and cakes.  I also saute and fry foods in it. On days I haven't cooked with coconut oil I have even been known to add some to a smoothie.Yes I am sold on the benefits of coconut oil and I'm happy I tried this brand of coconut oil.\"],\n",

We have six kids and a small budget :)Moving past the disclaimers this was good stuff. First of all it arrived right on time and I like the package. I suppose it was tough for them to decide what kind of package to put this in: since it is marketed both for cooking and 'skin and hair care'. The package stressed a little of the latter but was good for both.So far we have used the oil primarily for cooking. We have been trying to get away from the standard 'cooking oil'; especially as we have learned more and more about the evils of GMO foods and the way the big farmers and seed companies are using them to destroy small farmers and sufficiency growers. So I was glad to add this to the list of different oils we have been trying.Coconut oil was fun to use with a couple of tricks. My daughter says it burns a little easier than some other oils and I found out you can't use it in a marinade if the meat is too cold (the oil solidifies). But it was really great to use with my Chinese cooking. It really added a different taste twist especially to my chicken meals (we're not rich enough for me to have been able to fool around with shrimp like some other reviewers. Perhaps I can find a shrimp company that needs reviews :) ).I also used it on chicken that I would saute and then bake and it did well there. We found it goes well in a breaded baked chicken adding a different zip to the bread.All in all we really enjoyed this product and plan on continuing to. I can't speak to the price or comparison with similar oils as we are still getting started with our testing. Next I think we're going to try some Pecan oil...\"],\n",

The Viva didn't have a strong aroma of coconut oil upon opening (I know that some people don't like the stronger aromas but I do) but once I cut into it I could definitely smell a very light and pleasing scent.  I actually put it into my teas in the morning time and like the taste of coconut oil mixed with my herbal teas.  I know this is gross to some but for me it's heavenly.  I also use this for my skin hair and cooking. I believe that coconut oil has controlled my appetite smoothed my skin and allowed me to loose some weight.  Time will only tell if it will meet all of my needs but I wanted to point out the lighter less heavier coconut taste and smell and also the creamier spreadability as I know from reading other reviews that there are many differences in opinions.

       "  \"Let me start by saying - I am NOT a fan of eating anything coconut. I have used many shampoos and conditioners that have a coconut fragrance and I am fine with that.Prior to using this product I had used one other jar of coconut oil from a different source. There isn't much difference (in my opinion) in the two other than this being extra virgin and the previous one being virgin. The textures and scents seem very similar. (I rated this product 5 stars and would rate the other product I've used as 5 stars.)If you have not used coconut oil before know that it is a SOLID oil at room temperature not like most oils. It will warm up and melt in your hands if you use it as a beauty product - or on the stovetop if you cook with it.My container of coconut oil stays in the bathroom and I keep a spoon there to be able to easily get it out of the jar.One of my favorite ways to use coconut oil is on my hair - I simply put a little bit in my hands and rub them together to melt the oil then spread it through my hair after I shower. I tend to just leave it in my hair for the day and wash it out the next day when I shower but it will leave your hair oily/greasy looking so you may not be able to do that. I wear my hair in a bun and just call it a hat day when I've got oil in my hair. If you can't leave it in for a whole day try putting it in your hair overnight (you may want to use something to protect your pillow from getting greasy if you try this option) or just put it in fifteen minutes before you shower. Any of these options will have a similar end result with your hair being shiny and soft. I'd recommend using it on your hair about once a week.Another of my favorite ways to use coconut oil is to mix it in with my face moisturizer. I don't care for putting the coconut oil directly onto my face because it is very oily but mixing it in with my moisturizer leaves my face with a fresh shiny glow...and I like it as a base for using liquid makeup as it gives it good spreadability. You can do this as often as you like or just do it once a week for an extra treatment.Now I was curious because I've heard so many people saying that coconut oil does not taste like coconut but the smell when you open the jar is like a pure tropical explosion. I did taste a bit straight out of the jar and it didn't taste like I was eating shampoo (which most coconut foods taste like to me) but it did have a slight flavor. Definitely not as strong as I was expecting.I also used this in place of the oil in my regular pizza crust recipe and it gave the crust a wonderfully crispy texture and only if I was being really picky would I say it altered the flavor. It was the very slightest difference from the normal taste most people probably wouldn't even notice it. (My family didn't.)If I planned to use it in the kitchen and as a beauty product I would get two jars but for now my one jar stays happily in my bathroom.FTC Declaration: The manufacturer has provided me with a complimentary container of this product.

       "  'I have been using coconut oil for about 7 years now and I use it for lots of reasons: frying baking different types of skincare. The Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil worked great for all of those things (details below). But what set it apart from the other brands I have tried (the brands usually available at my local Whole Foods store) is the rich fresh coconut smell. Now I don\\'t use any oils that smell \"off but this oil had the freshest, sweetest smell of any coconut oils I have tried. Here\\'s how it worked for me:Baking: I melted a half cup of oil to make brownies. If your house is kept pretty warm, you might find coconut oil to be soft at room temperature, but we had to add some heat. Since I have lots of friends on modified diets (for reasons either religious or allergic), I like to bake gluten free, dairy free brownies fairly often. The coconut oil worked well with both GF flour and regular wheat flour. It moistens about the same as butter, but leaves a lighter crumb. While the fragrance of coconut oil is strong at first, it does not overwhelm the other flavors in baking. The Viva oil was a win here.Saute: I often cook greens or brussels sprouts in olive oil, but I wanted a saturated fat this go around. The Viva coconut oil did great for sauteing brussels sprouts, and again, though it smelled nice, it left a neutral flavor.Treating eczema: The Viva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil actually eliminated a bout of cold-weather eczema when I treated the affected area each night before bed. I was actually surprised that the eczema totally went away! I don\\'t know if it was the freshness of the oil, or a mild case, but I usually have to wrestle with a recurrent patch of eczema for a few months, and this oil got rid of it in two weeks.Facial moisturizer: My skin is quite sensitive right now, as I am expecting twins in the spring, so my usual moisturizers were irritating. Taking advice from a friends, I tried this Viva oil, and it works great as a facial moisturizer for sensitive skin. After a few minutes to soak in, my skin felt smooth and non-greasy. The fresh scent was lovely, too.Lip balm: This goes right along with face moisturizer. A nearly tasteless, but rich smelling alternative to processed lip balms, and it felt great!For shaving: Worked great!All in all, I would say that this oil worked as well as other organic extra virgin coconut oils for kitchen use, but its smell was the best of any others I\\'ve tried. The potency for skincare was unparalleled, though.

       "  'I am one of those people who keeps their food and beauty products separated. I remember in the 90s when mayonnaise was praised as a great hair treatment for all sorts of problems most likely also attracting the discerning bear when they come after you in the park. Then there is olive oil great for hair and skin. Though I am sure that there are benefits I just have a hard time thinking of lugging in a tub of Hellman\\'s to the bathtub in the hopes my hair becomes extra smooth. So you can imagine my skepticism when I received Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (henceforth referred to as EVCO) and read the label. There is also the minor issue that while I love the smell of coconut in my shampoos and the like there are few coconut food products that I eat (unless you count Lava Flow mixed drinks...). But I agreed to give my honest opinion of the product so I set my jaw and went to work.Flavor Food and DrinkAs I mentioned above I am not a huge eater of coconut foods. I absolutely despise shaved coconut on anything but the flavor of coconut infused into something without having to nosh on those horrible shavings tends to go over better. While apprehensive at first I opened the tub and dipped my finger in. The taste as can probably be imagined is VERY concentrated. It is not overpowering but between the lovely aroma and the strong \"tropical\" flavor you are definitely adding a distinctive flavor to your dish.For me I decided that I would use the oil for homemade ice cream. My recipe was simple: vanilla yogurt granulated sugar a tablespoon of the EVCO a pinch of salt heavy cream and some pineapple chunks. I blended everything together; the EVCO did not separate from the mix like you might expect. When combined with the creaminess of the dairy products and the traditional marriage of coconut and pineapple the result was delightfully exotic and definitely took me back to the time that I spent in Maui several years ago. In addition once added to the ice cream maker (I use the Kitchenaid kit for my mixer) it blended smoothly and into a consistent mixture of ice cream. Finally after sitting in the freezer overnight the EVCO-Pineapple ice cream set beautifully and was served over a slice of pound cake. The EVCO added a lovely flavor of coconut that was not overpowering and truly brought out the flavor of the ice cream.In summation: there are lots of other recipes that this product can be used for; I see other reviews that show it being used as a frying oil and also for other tasty vittles. Thus if you want a lovely coconut flavor for your savory sweet or mixed drinks the EVCO is a fine choice and is sure to please. The added bonus of it being USDA Organic is also a plus should you be concerned about the use of pesticides.Health & BeautyAfter I was able to get over my weird issues with bringing something that I have ingested as a food into the bathroom I discovered that EVCO is more than amazing when included in your hair and skin care routines. I first decided to try the oil on my fingernails; due to my lupus the skin cracks around them and it is rather painful. I have tried all sorts of lotions and creams to no avail. Since I had nothing to lose I gave the EVCO a chance. Over three days I used it twice daily massaging the oil into the skin. By the third day the skin was definitely softer but the cracks were still about the same as when I first started applying the EVCO. So as a moisturizer I can definitely attest to the efficacy of this product; if you have severely dry skin you may need to supplement the EVCO with another product. This is why I deducted one star from my rating. If the oil had healed my skin more so than it did this product would be a 5-star \"must have\".For hair care I took the following steps: I would shampoo my hair as normal with my usual brand (Garnier Fructis). After a thorough rinse I would pat my hair dry (not completely but enough so that water wasn\\'t dripping) and massage the oil slowly through my hair by starting at the scalp and working it down through the tips. My hair is curly and roughly shoulder length so it took roughly five-to-seven minutes to complete this part. Once I worked it in I let it sit for two minutes and then I rinsed it out completely. Afterward I allowed my hair to dry naturally; the end result was shiny lustrous hair that was not greasy or \"wet-looking\". In fact my hair looked so healthy that I have permanently shifted the bottle from my kitchen and into my bathroom! It has replaced my V05 Hot Oil Treatment products as my weekly deep moisturizing routine! It smells great leaves no residue and you will end up with sexy smooth shiny hair that will definitely earn you many compliments!Final SayTo summarize as I know that this review is rather lengthy:Pros:1) Smells great without being overpowering;2) Adds beautiful shine and a healthy nourishment when used as a moisturizer for hair;3) Helps to soften the skin when used as a lotion;4) Tastes great and is a wonderful product for both savory and sweet foods;5) Is USDA Organic so you know that you are getting a healthy product without the fear of fertilizers or other contaminants.Cons:1) While it helps as a skin moisturizer for any condition beyond \"regular dryness\" you may need a secondary product;2) I wish that the tub had a spout or some other method to ensure that the product stays sanitary when moving from the kitchen into the bathroom and vice/versa.Thus as you can see Viva Labs has a great product for you to use. It smells wonderful is extremely flexible for a variety of uses and no matter how you choose to add your purchase to your daily regimen I can assure you that you will be satisfied with the results!**Disclaimer: This headset was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

A friend of mine recommended I start using coconut oil. I did and I've tried several different brands of it. Some have been better than others.Viva Labs is definitely one of my favorite brands so far. The part I love most about it is the smell. It smells like coconut but not in an overwhelming way like a coconut-scented product might. When I put it on my skin after my shower it smells so sweet and fresh! (You might not know it but not all coconut oils actually smell good. Oils made from young coconuts smell lovely while oils made from old coconuts are unscented.)You may notice that this comes in a white plastic jar. This is a good thing I promise you. I've had coconut oils that come in glass or clear plastic jars and they don't last as long. The coconut oil I bought right before this came in a glass jar and actually got moldy! The white plastic jar protects the oil and keeps it fresh.I am also glad that it is made with non-GMO coconuts.

I use it all the time already so was delighted to receive a jar of Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil from Viva Labs in the mail.I did warn them: when I do a review I am ALWAYS honest. No sugar coating... if somethings a dud it\\'s a dud sorry.No worries: THIS IS A WINNER!Here are my test results:1) The \"Sniff Test\".  First thing when I opened the jar was the most fresh fragrant coconut smell. Nothing slightly \"off\" like I\\'ve experienced from a couple of other brands (and well known ones at that!).2) The \"Taste Test\". I dove right in and plopped a little blob right into my mouth: fresh clean VERY mild tasting and NO gag reflex. Sorry but I\\'ve had that reaction to those \"other\" brands. Like they were old or a tad bit rancid or something. Not this one. Fresh from the coconut tree thank you very much.3) Now for the \"Pet Test\". Yes I feed a tiny bit each day to my Kitties and Mini-Schnauzer. A very tiny lick each and they all are lively healthy shiny coated with fresh breath. Yep: it passed the Lick Test. They love it.4) Next the \"Beauty Test\". Yeppers I even use coconut oil on my face. I\\'m not a spring chicken but coconut oil gives me the facial skin of one. ;-)  But some brands have that \"off\" smell and feel kinda greasy. This one was great to use! The fragrance doesn\\'t linger too long so you don\\'t go around smelling like a tropical island but it soaks into clean skin fast leaving it soft silky and NOT greasy. It only takes a little bit too. Really... you just have to try it.5) Now for the \"Cooking Test\". I was a little leery of this one since I actually do NOT like to cook with coconut oils that have a strong coconut flavor. After awhile you get mighty tired of everything tasting of coconuts. But not to worry it was pretty mild. I could barely detect the flavor of coconut oil. Even though my frying pan is supposed to be non-stick (one of those healthy green coated kinds) it still works better with a dab of ghee or coconut oil. Besides coconut oil is GOOD for you it handles the heat of sauteing and is supposed to slightly speed up metabolism to aid in losing weight among other things. So passed the cooking test alright.6) The \"bullet proof coffee test\". Sorry... nuthin in the world can help me there. I just can\\'t choke down coffee with ANY brand of coconut oil floating on top like an oil spill. That\\'s not the coconut oils fault... it\\'s my gag reflex. Guess I\\'m a coffee snob but give me \"real\" coffee with cream and stevia thank you very much.Overall I really enjoyed trying this brand of coconut oil. It was a positive experience and I would definitely use this brand again. I had never heard of it before so am glad it\\'s on Amazon.

It is said that Coconut Oil has unique combination of fatty acids with powerful medicinal properties populations that eat a lot of coconut are among the healthiest people on the planet it increases your energy expenditure helping burn more fat it boost your immune system it kills hunger and makes you eat less and improves your blood cholesterol and many more.

So here goes...Yes I would recommend this wonderful product. The first thing I noticed about this product was the smell. It smells just like a Mounds candy bar .It has just the yummiest aroma about it.  Of course after opening the jar and smelling it I had to try it on my hands. I Love it!  It made my hand look and feel silky soft.  I thought to myself \"I will love to use it on my hands before washing dishes.\" Being a chef and washing dishes as much as I do while I cook (no I don\\'t have a dishwasher it is just me) my hands can get dry. You simply can\\'t put on gloves each time you wash a dish while cooking it is just not possible it slows me down too much. So my hands normally suffer. So that was the next test and do you know I love using this product right off the bat! On my hands it holds in my natural oil and repeals water. Wow! I was amazed.

       "  \"I am highly impressed with this coconut oil - it was love at first smell! I used this particular brand/product for my body not for cooking purposes. I have used it religiously for the past couple weeks when getting out of the shower and I've noticed an improvement in my skin's dryness. I also slather it on my face and it does not make me oily at all. One of my favorite things about this particular coconut oil is that I love the texture especially how it firms back up when under cooler temperatures. With other coconut oils I feel like once it melts it returns to a bit of a waxy state but this particular brand did not. It smells great feels great on my skin & is overall just a wonderful product. I'm hooked!\"],\n",

       "  'I\\'ve been following the paleo diet/lifestyle for almost 7 months now and can\\'t recommend it highly enough.As a quick side note I highly recommend the following two books: Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat Lose the Weight and Find Your Path Back to Health and Primal Body Primal Mind: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer Life they both helped me change my life.  I\\'ve lost about 40 pounds and gained muscle and feel amazingly better both physically and mentally.Enter coconut oil.Coconut oil was recommended to me by various authors (some paleo some general nutritionists) for the following functions:  cooking butter substitute frying hair skin and oil pulling.Oil pulling is the weirdest one you put a tablespoon of coconut oil in your mouth and swish it around for 20 minutes and then spit it out.  It\\'s supposed to do wonders for removing toxins and for general teeth/gum health.Anyway the consistency and  smoothness of this product was first rate when used for oil pulling.I\\'ve used it combined with some ghee for frying veggies and eggs and on some popcorn (yes popcorn is my big paleo cheat) and it works great.I wasn\\'t sure if there were any differences between this and my normal coconut oil besides consistency so I asked my girlfriend to try it and she exclaimed right away the smell was different than my normal oil.  And sure enough several other reviewers noticed this as well.  I smelled and tasted this oil along side my normal oil and sure enough it\\'s a bit different in consistency and taste.I like all the claims about organic non-gmo and so forth I\\'m going to assume that most coconut oils come from similar places (I think the Philippines probably leads the pack this is where my normal oil comes from) so it really comes down to processing and the care that goes into it.  I give this product 5 stars in that department.Like several other reviewers I was given a free sample to try at home which I was more than willing to do being an avid fan of coconut oil.I do put it in my hair on a regular basis and apply it to rough spots on my body like my elbows and I will sometimes lightly coat my face before going to bed with it.  It seems to be a really great skin and hair product and being totally natural I think it\\'s the place to start before using chemicals.Oh one more thing I drink a green smoothie nearly everyday using this Vibrant Health - Maximum Vibrance - 24.81 oz. with a few things added sunflower \"milk\" ice some raw eggs some nuts some fruit like blueberries sometimes a bit of kale and always a tablespoon of coconut oil.Now it\\'s hard to say exactly what does what I also use fish oil on a daily basis however I don\\'t add that to the smoothie as it ruins the flavor as where the coconut oil enhances the flavor so it\\'s hard to say exactly what health benefits I am getting from the coconut oil over say the fish oil or the other vitamins and supplements but I am confident that coconut oil is very beneficial to my health and I intend to continue using it on a daily basis that is from all the reading I\\'ve done about coconut oil in general.As far as this specific product:I do recommend it and feel it\\'s first rate.'],\n",

       "  \"I have tried coconut oil before but my results were so so. The kind that I had bought from a store was really hard and I had to pry it out and melt it. It also was expeller pressed which I think had a major difference in its quality and how it performed on my skin and hair. It was organic but it was also refined. I like using all natural products to solve my skin and hair needs and had always heard how great coconut oil was for these purposes. When I received this coconut oil in the mail I immediately opened it to see if it was the same hard stuff that I had gotten before with the other brand. I was so happy to see that it wasn't. Not saying it flows like a lotion or anything but I could get it out easily. It also has a beautiful smell that the other kind didn't. I tried it on my horribly dry feet and hands and they felt so much better after I used this coconut oil. I continued to use it on my dry skin and my skin hasn't been this smooth in years! Next was to test how well it performed on my hair. I applied the coconut oil all over my hair except my roots wrapped it up with a plastic bag then wrapped it up with a hot towel. I left this on for about an hour then rinsed it all out. I could tell a difference in that my hair did feel more smooth and there was less frizz. I plan to do this about once a week now :)I haven't tried it with cooking or anything but I do know of a study of coconut oil and alzheimer's. Alzheimer's runs in my husband's family so the ones effected have been seeking methods to help with it. It has been shown that coconut oil has helped people with alzheimer's. I saw on Discovery Health once about a woman whose husband had alzheimer's pretty badly. She decided to try the coconut oil approach to see if it would help him. There was one point where she had him draw a clock and the clock was completely unrecognizable. After a time of cooking with coconut oil taking coconut oil supplements etc. the drawings of the clock continued to improve. Now I am no doctor but I do know that coconut oil is helping my husband's great aunt in her struggle with alzheimer's. Seems like coconut oil can not only help with the body on the outside but may be able to help heal the inside.I received this product for my honest review. This is my opinion after receiving and testing this product myself.\"],\n",

This coconut oil has more of a slightly nutty coconut flavor than Nature's Way which tastes like just a bland oil. Both have the same lightness. I have also tried Trader Joe's coconut oil but found it felt like a heavy bomb in my stomach. My favorite use for coconut oil is to put it on my gluten free toast with a sprinkle of sesame seeds on top of that! I also like to add 1 T of coconut oil in my Caffix (or coffee if that's your pref) with goat's milk then add some coconut sugar to sweeten. Finally then whip it with a wire whisk (just rub the whisk handle between your hands like you are starting a stick fire!) then it froths like a rich cappuccino!\"],\n",

I love the fact that it is organic and I like that it hasn't been overly processed.I prefer the texture of this oil to the others that I have used especially for my hair and skin.  It's hard to explain why but it just feels better to me.  It's not as grainy.It still has a pretty good scent and taste of coconuts so if you use it to cook there is no mistaken that you've used coconut oil.Overall for the price I'd say this is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it.I received a sample for review.\"],\n",

It's also great for cooking - it's a much healthier alternative to other cooking oils and provides vital nutrients. In short it's just an awesome product that has many uses.For those that don't know coconut oil melts at roughly 76 degrees so be careful when opening it on a hot day. It melts rather quickly just sitting in the palm of your hand and spreads easily on the skin. As long as you don't use too much it doesn't leave a gross residue or anything. I recommend putting a bit in your hair about an hour before showering - it will really help with dry damaged hair and possibly with dandruff. It really replenishes your hair and leaves it nice and shiny and healthy.Overall this is one of the best organic unrefined coconut oils I've used and I highly recommend it.\"],\n",

       "  \"Viva's Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is excellent for cooking for taking internally for oil pulling and for skin care.  Spelling slightly of coconuts my just oiled hands call the pets to lick it off.I use this oil for sauteing instead of olive oil because it does not smoke when I heat it to high heat while olive oil will burn easily at high temperatures.  I have also used this coconut oil when making brownies.  The slight coconut scent is just barely noticeable after cooking and makes these brownies memorable.I have not tried this oil on my hair but on skin it's great!  I use it daily on hands and feet.  It soaks into skin quickly and leaves it feeling supple.Viva's coconut oil contains only small amounts of medium chain triglycerides so if you are attempting to increase the amount of those in your diet this oil will not be what you want.  MCT oil is available on Amazon.com.I have used Viva Labs products in the past and found them to be as good or better than any other similar products from other manufacturers so I have developed trust in products from Viva.  This coconut oil has so far been as good or better than other coconut oils I have used and with so many uses for this product I like to have an extra jar on hand. I highly recommend this particular oil.Five Stars!\"],\n",

       "  \"When I first discovered coconut oil I picked up an organic jar from the grocery store - however I wasn't impressed and didn't find it to be the miraculous product everyone had claimed.  In fact it didn't even smell like coconut.  After some label inspection I discovered it was refined and therein lied the problem.  I embarked on a mission to find a truly organic unrefined extra virgin coconut oil.Which brought me to Nature's Way EfaGold. Organic Pure Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 32-Ounce Jar.  Finally I understood why everyone was nuts for coconut oil!  I started off using it in a few recipes and even tried it as a luxurious lotion.  Then I began to use it in baking which is when I really fell in love.  I was amazed with its ability to completely substitute for butter.  Now I use coconut oil for everything from cooking baking topping cosmetics.Viva Labs contacted me with this product and told me I wouldn't be disappointed.  A cocoNUT convert I eagerly hopped on the opportunity to try it.  The first thing I noticed when I opened the jar was the delicious coconut aroma.  That's how I knew it was the real deal.  But would it pass the taste test?That night I put two tablespoons in my popcorn popper.  Result?  Delicious buttery corn!The next day I made a cake and when it came time for the frosting I subbed out the butter for an equal amount of coconut oil.  The result?  Rich creamy mouth-watering frosting with just a hint of coconut.A couple of days later I made chocolate chip cookies and again subbed out the butter for coconut oil.  The result?  You guessed it: nummy cookie goodness!I used it in a sea scallop saute.  I spread it on toast for breakfast.  I put it on waffles.  I put this coconut oil through every test in my house and it passed all with flying colors.  I'm hooked!For me the only con is that it is only available in a 15 oz. tub.  As you can imagine I use a lot of coconut oil in the kitchen and a 32 oz. container not only makes it easier for me to get a measuring cup inside but it also creates less waste.  I'd love to see it become available in a larger size.\"],\n",

I use it to fry eggs for breakfast in smoothies and in my coffee and love the extra depth of flavor this product adds. I have yet to bake with it but judging from how it has preformed elsewhere I'm sure it will be great. As far as using this on the skin/hair- I love it! Right after I got this product I had a pretty bad sunburn. This soothed my skin and has proven to be a better lotion than the pricey ones I am sometimes inclined to buy. My skin is also ultra-sensitive. I have used this on my face a night twice and both times I have woken up with bright skin many of my breakouts were cleared up and the surface of my skin looked and felt smoother. This product is truly a must-have for any kitchen or bathroom. From hair masks to baking cookies and cakes the uses are literally endless.I will say that there is a distinct coconut smell that may transfer onto clothes or sheets. I don't mind this because coconut is one of my favorite scents and the smell tends to dissipate quickly but just one thing to keep in mind when purchasing this product.

I've washed my face with this product several times already massaging just a bit into my skin. A little goes a long way. Then I used a face cloth with hot water and briskly cleaned my skin. It gave me a fresh look but not dry or irritated. There was just enough moisure to allow my foundation to go on smoothly. Because I was careful to remove the excess coconut oil I did not get an oily look on my face as the day went on and my skin felt great.Incadentally I thought my face was already clean when I applied the coconut oil but more foundation came off on the cloth! Because this goes so far I can imagine this 16 ounce jar lasting for months. After doing tons of housework I massaged it into my cuticles with excellent results. It even seemed to improve my nails preventing the annoying chipping at the edges I've been experiencing. Good stuff!\"],\n",

Once liquified I poured it on her scalp and rubbed it in.  It definitely helped with the dry skin but because the cradle cap was so stubborn I eventually I had to start using olive oil on her scalp.

This practice is called oil pulling and this jar happens to be the perfect size to travel with.  Sometimes I do my swishing routine while on my 2 hour commute through LA traffic.  It's great for preventing plaque and removing toxins.  Healthy gums are everything!First thing once out of the shower as well as the last thing before I sleep I basically coat my entire body and face in it.  It's truly magical for preventing wrinkles and moisturizing without toxic chemicals.  It smells nice and is not at all overpowering.  I no longer need purchase lotions or expensive moisturizers.  This stuff is natures greatest gift.Prior to eating I take 2 to 3 tablespoons of it orally.  Coconut oil has strong antiviral powers as well as proving through personal experience that it aids in food digestion and removal of waste.  Viva Labls Organic in particular is just my favorite as far as mild taste and brilliant packaging.  Not sure why other Coconut oils seems to come in these ridiculous oversized vitamin bottles however their packaging just happens to make my constant need and dependency on this stuff very easy to access without mess throughout the day.I credit the ingestion of this coconut oil with curing my chronic sinus infection.  If you commit to daily use the benefits will pleasantly surprise you.  Your skin will glow. You will feel better.  Seriously.Oh yes I nearly forgot the greatest benefit!  I work as a hairstylist and instead of pushing products I just suggest my client buy this stuff and use it to condition their hair once a week.  Personally I've seen a major difference in the softness and movement in my hair since beginning to use it.

You don't want to use it in everything as it has a bit of a sweet flavor (pesto sauce with this in place of olive oil might be a little odd) but anything that can benefit with a little sweetness is great with this.
