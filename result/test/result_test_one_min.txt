 This is a 30 second test. In this test I will see if the model records the first 30 seconds of audio or if it records the last 30 seconds of audio. Currently 15 seconds have elapsed and there are still about 20 seconds left. I am going to stop this recording and approximately 1 minute. So if this is recording the last 30 seconds it begins now. If it begins now to record what I am saying then it records the last 30 seconds. Otherwise it records the first 30 seconds. This is an experiment to understand how whisper works. I am using the base model and I have to keep speaking otherwise it will think there is no audio and won't give me anything. And 3, 2, 1, stop.
